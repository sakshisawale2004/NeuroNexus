# NeuroNexus
This project is a machine learning solution to predict passenger survival on the Titanic, based on features like age, sex, fare, and class. Built as part of the NeuroNexus Data Science  Task

# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction
This project is a machine learning solution to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. It is developed as part of **Task 1** for the **NeuroNexus Data Science Internship**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Using the Titanic dataset, we trained several classification models to predict survival based on features like:
- Passenger class (Pclass)
- Sex
- Age
- Fare
- Number of siblings/spouses (SibSp)
- Number of parents/children (Parch)
- Port of Embarkation (Embarked)

## 🧠 Models Used
- Random Forest Classifier  


## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1 Score)

## 📈 Visualizations
- Heatmaps of confusion matrix  
- Bar plots of model performance  
- Feature distribution plots

## 🧪 User Input Prediction
A simple script allows users to input passenger details and get real-time survival predictions using the trained model.

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📁 Files Included
- `Titanic_Prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook with EDA, modeling, and evaluation
- `README.md`: Project description
